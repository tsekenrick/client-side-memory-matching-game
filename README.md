# Memoremoji - A Memory Matching Game

This is a recreation of a classic memory game where pairs of cards are arranged in a grid, and the player is tasked with matching up
all the pairs within a certain number of turns.

The logic of the application is almost entirely client-side, and relies on events to manipulate the DOM as necessary to display the game state.
